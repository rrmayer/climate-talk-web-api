# ClimateTalk Protocol Specification

*From the docs:*

> ClimateTalk is a universal language for innovative, cost-effective solutions that optimize performance, efficiency and home comfort. The ClimateTalk Open Standards define a set of messages and commands to enable interoperability, enhanced user interface, and machine to machine control independent of the physical layer connecting the devices.

Once upon a time, these documents were hosted on the web, freely available by the [ClimateTalk Alliance](http://www.climatetalkalliance.org/). Now, "the lights are on, but nobody's home" as they say. Therefore, we've got them here for reference.
